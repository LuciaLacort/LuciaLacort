## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Digital Project Manager with a strong foundation in development and a passion for building impactful digital experiences. I lead projects end-to-end—coordinating clients, teams, and vendors, while managing timelines, budgets, and technical execution. I stay hands-on with code, supporting both current stack and legacy systems, and I adapt quickly to new tools and workflows. I take pride in maintaining an organized, efficient infrastructure and continuously learning to tackle new challenges with autonomy and accountability.
